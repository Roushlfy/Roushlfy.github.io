I am Xiong Zhixiao, a thrid-year undergraduate student from Weiyang College, Tsinghua University. I am currently pursuing a double degree in Mathematics and Physics + Industrial Engineering. My academic voyage is fueled by a relentless curiosity and a strong penchant for delving into the realms of combinatorial optimization and machine learning (CO with ML). My intellectual spark was significantly ignited by a seminal paper, [Learning to Branch in Mixed Integer Programming](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10080), which later morphed into the catalyst for my ongoing research endeavor.

My commitment to academic excellence is mirrored in my noteworthy GPA of 3.98/4.0 during my first year. This trend of academic diligence continued into my second year with a respectable GPA of 3.93/4.0 for the first two years. My academic journey extends beyond the confines of the classroom into the explorative world of research. During my sophomore year, I volunteered for two pivotal research projects. The first, titled "Algorithm Development and Open Source Framework Construction for Curriculum Learning," allowed me to self-learn machine learning concepts, implement algorithms, and conduct benchmark tests. My summer was meaningfully invested in a project concerning "NeuralQP: A General Hypergraph-based Optimization Framework for Large-scale Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs". I am the leading author of the paper, which is currently under review for the 2021 International Conference on Representation Learning (ICLR).

My vision is clear and forward-looking. I aspire to pursue a doctoral degree from a prestigious institution outside China, with a long-term aspiration rooted in academia. I staunchly believe in the power of collaboration and am always open to discussions, engagements, and cooperative ventures that will enrich both my academic and research experience.

From September 2023 to January 2024, I will be studying at the University of Toronto as an exchange student.

I look forward to the myriad of learning and collaborative opportunities that lay ahead. Through my personal and academic pursuits, I am eagerly diving into the field of CO with ML, driven by an insatiable quest for knowledge and a genuine passion for research.
